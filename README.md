StoplightTDD
============

Code for building a CSS stoplight, powering it with JavaScript and unit testing it with QUnit.

## Code

To view the example, open 'stoplight.html'

## Unit Tests

The unit tests are all in 'test'.  Open each .html file individually to run all the tests.

## Notes

This example was from my 2013 Adobe Max talk on TDD.  If you have any code suggestions or additional tests, feel free to
